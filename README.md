========
# read the column names
# read the X data file
# names of subset columns required
# subset the data (done early to save memory)
# append the activity id and subject id columns
# return the data
# read test data set, in a folder named "test", and data file names suffixed with "test"
# read test data set, in a folder named "train", and data file names suffixed with "train"
# Merge both train and test data sets
# Also make the column names nicer
# Add the activity names as another column
# Combine training and test data sets and add the activity label as another column
# Create a tidy data set that has the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# melt the dataset
# recast 
# Create the tidy data set and save it on to the named file
